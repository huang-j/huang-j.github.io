I've finally finished this. It took me a while, but I learned a lot along the way. I got the chance to learn html/css in practice. I kind of bullshitted my way through the javascript (thanks internet!). But here I am! I highly recommend you click on the navigation bar on the first page. Took me a while to get that scrolling stuff down.

The projects page is empty right now as I haven't decided on what I'm going to do with it. Definitely linking to my github (which is pretty empty...). And I haven't added a contact page yet. I am considering adding comments to posts if I ever feel like doing that. But hey, this is a place for my opinions, not yours!

I should also look up some markdown syntax.
