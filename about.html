<p>I am Jonathan Huang. I graduated about a year ago from Washington University in St. Louis and now am just lollygagging around until I go do other things.</p>

<p>You might be asking, "Jonathan, why did you decide to write this blog? It's not like anybody is going to read this." You drive an excellent point <u>your name here</u>. But <i>you</i> are reading this right at this moment!</p>

<p>To be completely honest, however, I'm not expecting a flood of people coming to visit me in my humble abode. But with the current events across the globe I find myself with an opinion. An opinion that I will nuture and develop. An opinion that I will mostly forget since I didn't write it down. This blog is the remedy.</p>

<p>So what is this blog to you (the reader)? I can't really say. Sometimes I will write about small events such as falling asleep in the shower. Other times it'll be about something bigger, such as politics, science, or even religion. Some of you may be a friend who just wants to know about the inner workings of my head. Some of you may just have stumbled in boredom. So I don't know what you will take away from this. I'll try my best to provide sources, support my opinions, and of course be entertaining while I'm at it. And who knows, maybe you'll learn something.</p>
